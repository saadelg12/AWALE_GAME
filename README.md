## Project Overview

**Awale** is a classic African strategy game. This project allows players to compete in an exciting and strategic game, manage their profiles, connect with friends, and view past games. Below youâ€™ll find instructions on how to install the game, as well as a full list of commands for interaction.

## Installation

Open (at least) two terminal windows : one for the server side and (at least) one for the client side.

To compile the program for the server-side, first make sure that you're in the project root and execute the command below:

```bash
cd server
make
```

Do the same thing to compile the program for the client-side, except change the directory to `client`:

```bash
cd client
make
```

To execute the program, both executables for the client and the server can be found in the `bin` directory.

For server:
  - From server side:

```bash
./bin/server
```

For client: 
  - From client side: 

```bash
./bin/client [ip_address] [username]
```

  - **Example**:
    ```bash
    ./bin/client 127.0.0.1 Saad
    ```
  - **NB** : 
    - If the client is already registered, he will be asked to enter his password.
    - If the client is not in the users'base in /server/users.csv, he will be asked to chose a password, and persisted with an empty bio. Passwords are encrypted in the users.csv file.
    - If the client is already online, he won't be able the enter the game again unless he logs out from his current session.

To clean and recompile the program, simply use the following command in both the `client` and `server` sides:

```bash
make clean
```
